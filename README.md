# Django Delights
## A capstone project about a fictional restuarant called "Django Delights" from the CodeCademy website. 
This project contains an app that helps keep track of how much food is in Django Delights' inventory throughout the day. Built by me, Kaitlin Lovrich.

## This project is currently in progress and is incomplete. 

### What does/will the Inventory app do?
Through the app, the "owner" will be able to: 
+ Enter in new recipes along with their recipe requirements, and assign a price to their new menu item.
+ Add to the inventory a name of an ingredient, its price per unit, and how much of that item is available.
+ Enter in a customer purchase of a menu item. When a customer purchases an item off the menu, the inventory will be modified to accommodate what happened, as well as recording the time that the purchase was made.
+ Display a list of menu items available for purchase, not for purchase (due to lack of inventory), and an inventory list.

### Requirements:
The following packages are required for this script to work.
+ django

To install these packages, you can simply run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
